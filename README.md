Here lies code to implement an adaptive Bayesian parameter search for the contrast psychometric function. This relies on a look ahead algorithm that finds the ideal stimulus level to present on the next trial. 

The code is implemented in a matlab class, see `example.m` for usage.

More documentation to come. Check out these references for the time being: 

* See [here](https://doi.org/10.1167/17.3.10) and [here](https://doi.org/10.1167/16.10.25) to get an overview of the what this algorithm is doing.
* See [here](https://doi.org/10.1167/13.7.3)  for an understanding of marginalising 'nuisance' parameters and why this helps.
